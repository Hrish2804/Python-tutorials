# Tuples are same like list but they cannot be rechanged. It means the value remains fixed and cannot be changed.

# t = () # Empty Tuple
# t = (1, )   # a tuple with 1 value needs a comma(,). Otherwise it will throw an error
t = (5,3,4,5) 

# print(t)

# # So lets check by changing it value
# t[2] = 6 
# print(t)    # It will throw an error

#       M   E   T   H   O   D   S       #


t = (0 , 0 , 5 , 0 )
print(t.count(0))      # It will count the defined value 
print(t.index(0))       # It will give us the address of the value entered
